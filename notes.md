# Fundaments

## Prepare to Write Java Code

1. Install JDK, so you can compile and run code.
2. need a text editor to write code.

### Running your first code

There 2 things to note

1. package name: when the source code file isn't in current directory, you should name a package name in source code explicitly.
2. classpath: when the class file isn't in current directory, you should add -cp=classfilepath or -cp=./ to specify the location of the class file.
